# pencil it in

### pencil it in is the first shared calendar built for friends, not meetings.

pencil it in shows your friendsâ€™ current plans instantlyâ€”no invites,
no back-and-forth, just instant visibility to meet up with your friends fast.

- Your feed shows every event that your friends want you to go to. There are no invite lists, your entire friends list
  can see every event you make.
- You and your friends lead busy lives, make spontaneous plans and invite your friends to meet you at the hiking trail
  or the mall with no pressure to attend. Or, open your feed and easily join a friend on a simple errand.
