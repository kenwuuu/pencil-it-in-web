### pencil it in is the first shared calendar built for friends, not meetings.

Pencil It In is the first shared calendar built for friends—not work, not meetings, just real-life, low-pressure plans
with the people you care about.


Spontaneous hangouts? Lazy park days? Quick bites after a workout? Pencil It In makes it easy to see what your friends
are up to—and even easier to join them.

### 📝 No Invites. No Pressure. Just Plans.

Your feed shows all the events your friends want you to join. There’s no need to send invites or create another group
chat. Create an event, and your friends can see it and join if they’re free. That’s it.

Whether it’s a casual hike, a coffee stop between errands, or a late-night hang at the park—Pencil It In is built for
day-to-day, spontaneous plans that fit into real life.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- Open Invite Events: Every event is shared with all of your friends or close friends—no need to type in thirty
  usernames.
- Instant Visibility: See what your friends are doing right now, this afternoon, or tomorrow.
- No Back-and-Forth: Skip the texts and scheduling. Just show up if you can.
- Low-Stakes, High-Fun: Join or host plans with zero pressure. No commitment necessary.

### 🌎 Designed for Real Life

Planning a trip into the city? Hanging out in a park for a few hours? Heading to the local farmer’s market? Just pencil
it in—and let your friends decide if they can join. It’s like bumping into a friend at the perfect moment, but better.

You can even use Pencil It In as a simple calendar app—but with smarter, easier sharing built in. No emails. No
workplace energy. Just friends.

**Make more moments happen. See more of the people you care about. Pencil it in.**

## First Time Contributors

We use Alpine, DaisyUI, and Tailwind. Most of these can be easily seen in our code.
If your change doesn't use these libraries when it should, it's possible that I might ask you
to rewrite it.

These libraries were chosen for being simple to learn and use, and to speed up development. It
shouldn't take you too long to start using them, read their docs to learn them.
