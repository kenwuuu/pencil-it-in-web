# pencil it in

### pencil it in is the first shared calendar built for friends, not meetings.

pencil it in shows your friendsâ€™ current plans instantlyâ€”no invites,
no back-and-forth, just instant visibility to meet up with your friends fast.

- Your feed shows every event that your friends want you to go to. There are no invite lists, your entire friends list
  can see every event you make.
- You and your friends lead busy lives, make spontaneous plans and invite your friends to meet you at the hiking trail
  or the mall with no pressure to attend. Or, open your feed and easily join a friend on a simple errand.

## First Time Contributors

We use Alpine, DaisyUI, and Tailwind. Most of these can be easily seen in our code.
If your change doesn't use these libraries when it should, it's possible that I might ask you
to rewrite it.

These libraries were chosen for being simple to learn and use, and to speed up development. It
shouldn't take you too long to start using them, read their docs to learn them.

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before your first contribution.
