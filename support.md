# How to Use Pencil It In

## 📌 No Invites. No Pressure. Just Plans.

Your feed shows all the events your friends want you to join. There’s no need to send invites or create another group
chat. Create an event, and your friends can see it and join if they’re free. That’s it.
Whether it’s a casual hike, a coffee stop between errands, or a late-night hang at the park—Pencil It In is built for
day-to-day, spontaneous plans that fit into real life.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Open Invite Events: Every event is shared with your full friend group or close friends—no RSVP needed.
Instant Visibility: See what your friends are doing right now, this afternoon, or tomorrow.
No Back-and-Forth: Skip the texts and scheduling. Just show up if you can.
Low-Stakes, High-Fun: Join or host plans with zero pressure. No commitment necessary.

## 🌎 Designed for Real Life

Planning a trip into the city? Hanging out in a park for a few hours? Heading to the local farmer’s market? Just pencil
it in—and let your friends decide if they can join. It’s like bumping into a friend at the perfect moment, but better.

You can even use Pencil It In as a simple calendar app—but with smarter, easier sharing built in. No emails. No
workplace energy. Just friends.
